![image](https://github.com/donspablo/stonexy/assets/6468571/efaa99ac-299c-4975-ab63-182a2d79f65a)

Stonexy is a powerful tool that enables you to create a web proxy, mirror a desired website, and domain the
application on Vercel. By following these expert instructions, you can set up Stonexy and deploy it on Vercel:

1. Create a Next.js Project:
    - Set up a new Next.js project or use an existing one. Ensure you have Next.js installed globally or within your
      project.

2. Install Dependencies:
    - Open your project directory in a terminal or command prompt.
    - Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
      ```
      npm install http-proxy-middleware next
      ```

3. Configure the Proxy:
    - Within your Next.js project, create a new directory named `api`.
    - Inside the `api` directory, create a file named `proxy.cts`.
    - In `proxy.cts`, import the required modules:
      ```javascript
      const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware');
      const { NextApiHandler } = require('next');
      ```

    - Implement the proxy configuration and create a Next.js API route handler:
      ```javascript
      const targetHost = 'https://example.com'; // Replace with your desired website URL
 
      const proxy = createProxyMiddleware({
        target: targetHost,
        changeOrigin: true,
      });
 
      const handler = (req, res) => {
        proxy(req, res);
      };
 
      export default handler;
      ```

4. Deploy on Vercel:
    - Commit your changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).
    - Connect your Next.js project to a Git repository, such as GitHub or GitLab, using the Vercel dashboard.
    - Configure the deployment settings, such as the branch to deploy and the build command (typically `npm run build`).
    - Once configured, deploy your Next.js project on Vercel by initiating the deployment process.

5. Verify and Use the Proxy:
    - Once the deployment is successful, Vercel will provide you with a unique URL for your application.
    - Access the deployed application and append `/api/proxy` to the URL (
      e.g., `https://your-vercel-project.vercel.app/api/proxy`).
    - This will act as the proxy endpoint, mirroring the desired website specified in the `targetHost` variable.

By following these expert instructions, you can leverage Stonexy to create a web proxy and domain the application
on
Vercel. This allows you to mirror a desired website while utilizing the power and scalability of the Vercel hosting
platform.

# 1. Forking the Repository:

- Navigate to the repository you wish to fork on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub).
- Click on the "Fork" button located in the top right corner of the repository's page.
- Wait for the platform to create a copy of the repository under your account. Once the process is complete, you will be
  redirected to the forked repository.

# 2. Rewriting the Target Host Name in api/proxy.cts:

- Locate the api/proxy.cts file within the forked repository's directory structure.
- Open the proxy.cts file using a suitable code editor.
- Look for a variable or constant that defines the target domain name, typically named targetHost or something similar.
- Modify the assigned value of the target domain name to the desired value. In this case, replace "google.com" with the
  desired domain name.
- Save the changes made to the proxy.cts file.

You will now have successfully forked the repository and rewritten the target domain name in the api/proxy.cts file.
These actions allow you to create your own copy of the repository and customize the target domain to suit your needs.

```js
const {createProxyMiddleware} = require("http-proxy-middleware");

module.exports = (req, res) => {
    let target = "https://www.google.com/";//your website url
    //   if (
    //     req.url.startsWith("/api") ||
    //     req.url.startsWith("/auth") ||
    //     req.url.startsWith("/banner") ||
    //     req.url.startsWith("/CollegeTask")
    //   ) {
    //     target = "http://106.15.2.32:6969";
    //   }

    createProxyMiddleware({
        target,
        changeOrigin: true,
        pathRewrite: {
            // rewrite request path `/backend`
            //  /backend/user/login => https://google.com/user/login
            //   "^/backend/": "/",
        },
    })(req, res);
