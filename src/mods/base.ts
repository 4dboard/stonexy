//This code exports a module in Node.js that allows for replacing specific elements in a target website's HTML structure. The module defines an object literal with key-value pairs, where the keys represent elements to be replaced and the values represent the replacements. In this case, the code replaces occurrences of "<span" with "<x" and "span>" with "x>". For example, "<span class="highlight">" would be transformed into "<x class="highlight">". Other modules can import and use this module to perform these element replacements, offering a flexible method for modifying specific elements in the HTML structure of the target website.
